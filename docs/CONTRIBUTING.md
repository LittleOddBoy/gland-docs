# Contributing to Gland

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gland! We welcome contributions of all kinds, whether it's reporting a bug, proposing a feature, or submitting a pull request (PR). Please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or an issue with the documentation, please follow these steps:

- **Search for existing issues:** Before reporting a new issue, please check if the issue has already been reported. You can search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/glandjs/gland/issues).
- **Create a new issue:** If you couldn't find a similar issue, please create a new one. When opening a new issue, use the appropriate template (`bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`, or `documentation.yml`) to provide the necessary details. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to fix the issue.

### 2. Pull Requests

If you're submitting a pull request (PR) to fix a bug or add a feature, please ensure that you:

- **Follow the semantic commit convention**: Use the following commit message format for your changes:

  - **fix:** for bug fixes
  - **feat:** for new features
  - **docs:** for documentation changes
  - **style:** for formatting changes (e.g., indentation, semi-colons, etc.)
  - **refactor:** for code refactors that do not change functionality
  - **test:** for adding or modifying tests
  - **chore:** for routine maintenance (e.g., dependency updates)

  Example: `feat: add support for custom event handlers`

- **Write clear commit messages:** Each commit should represent a logical unit of work. Provide a concise explanation of what the commit does.

- **Ensure the code works:** Before submitting a PR, run tests and ensure that everything works as expected.

- **Link to the issue:** If your PR addresses an existing issue, mention it in the PR description (e.g., `Closes #123`).

- **Create a descriptive PR title and description:** Be clear about the changes you made and how they address the issue at hand.

### 3. Discussion & Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement, we encourage you to discuss it first. Open a new issue or post your idea in our community.

- **Community discussions:** For general discussions or feature suggestions, please use our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/nSMaEXkMUz).
- **Feature requests:** If you're requesting a new feature, please provide context on how it will improve the project and why it's needed.
